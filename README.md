# better-feed
**Better Feed** is a web app for to help people gain greater control of, and develop a more meaningful relationship with, their social feeds.


Purpose
---

This app was originally conceived as a tool for Twitter users to use to examine an individual account's tweets and determine whether that account provides value to the user. In simpler terms, this app will help you decide who to unfollow on Twitter. An app like this is necessary, not just beacause it provides this judicial context, but because the value of a single account is lost in the sea of tweets that is the Twitter Timeline.

Technology
---

This web app was built using Ruby on Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, the Twitter API, and some JavaScript. It is deployed thanks to Heroku.
